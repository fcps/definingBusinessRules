                    <li>Mutually Exclusive</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Everything in a computer is black and white (or 0/1), so rules must be as well.</li>
                            <li>For each rule there needs to be a consistent way to identify a single valid value.</li>
                            <li><strong>It is not a rule if any records can fall into multiple categories simultaneously.</strong></li>
                        </ul>

                        <li>As an example, can a student have free and reduced price lunch status simultaneously?</li>
                        <li>If the answer is no, the condition is mutually exclusive.</li>
                        <li>If the answer is yes, you would need additional branches/nodes in the tree.</li>

                            <li>This is the time where <em>"What if"</em> scenarios are extraordinarily valuable and helpful.</li>

                        <li>Because some DB developers want to take short cuts that degrade data quality, sometimes there are additional unmentioned rules.</li>

                        <li>The process starts when a user logs in to their system.</li>
                        <li>The login creates a new session ID to identify all the things that happen in that session.</li>
                        <li>Then we ask whether or not the user has logged out</li>
                        <li>If they have logged out that would indicate the end of the session and the last record with that session ID</li>
                        <li>If they haven't logged out, we ask if they've been active within the past 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>If they have not been active in the last 30 minutes the NWEA platform logs the user out and ends the session</li>
                        <li>If they have been active in the last 30 minutes, we go back to checking if they've logged out.</li>
                        <li>No report views can be attributed to multiple session IDs for a single user and there are no cases that aren't covered.  Either the user logs out, or the system logs them out after 30 minutes of no activity</li>
